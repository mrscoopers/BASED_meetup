Search is evolving fast: from new algorithms and tools to AI-driven solutions, the field is constantly shifting. 
BASED Meetup is where professionals & enthusiasts discuss the **latest trends, breakthroughs and challenges in modern search**.

​We dive into topics like:
- Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG);
- Innovative approaches to sparse, dense, and hybrid retrieval;
- Advances in indexing algorithms and vector quantization;
- Modern metrics for search quality;
- Optimization techniques for production-scale systems;
- Cross-lingual and multimodal search challenges;
- The intersection of search and generative AI;
… and much more.

​No sales pitches, no gatekeeping — just an open space to share ideas, learn from each other, and explore the technologies shaping the future of search.
​Whether you're building production systems, researching search algorithms, or just curious about the field, **you're welcome here**.
